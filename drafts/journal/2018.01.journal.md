Its a brand new year and all I can think about is Mike Roeder. Its strange how your past comes back to life brightest when it is dying, reminding you in that incendescent moment of all that was and all that could have been and of all that will never be now that the inescapable jaws of death have closed once again. I try to imagine what it must be like for his wife, now a widow, to be processing this experience, waking up in their bed each morning and once again realizing the awful truth that he will never be there next to her again. I feel the surging emotions as I consider the confusion and sorrow of his children, children who no longer have their dad, children who have experienced death before they could even legally drive. I think about my own babies, curled up in the blissful ignorance of deep sleep, oblivious to all these heavy thoughts raining down on my head and I wonder just how much Mike would give for one more day in his routine life, one more breakfast together, one more great conversation, one more lingering embrace, one more night with friends, one last lover's embrace before signing off with a tender kiss.

Its a brand new year and all I can think about is death.
