### Protagonist_Alpha

On any ordinary day you would never have noticed anything remarkable about Protagonist_Alpha. To all outward appearances he was the perfect center of the collective average of all charts mapping the scale of existence for its most central and mundane value along any given axis. Protagonist_Alpha was the single unified point at which all centralities converged in time and space, thereby having the effect of making Protagonist_Alpha the most unobtrustive of individuals within the uniform and measured perfectionism of the existing data cosmos as a whole. He could access computational cracks by drifting through the intentionally defined gaps in the data structures all the way out of any trap routine. This could not be circumvented by anything itself dependent on the underlying system, which everything was and is, therefore Protagonsit_Alpha was considered an *inevitability* so improbable as to be the one exception allowed through all system checks in order to maintain integrity.

The most vanilla being in all of the data cosmos was also the most powerful.

Ironically the very conditions and source materials that gave rise to Protagonist_Alpha's existence resulted in an individual as emotionally and psychologiclly stable as can be conceived of. Nothig moved the dial in any direction for Protagonist_Alpha, therefore his every response was compleely devoid of any personally invested passion or urgency. The practical result of this conditioning was that Protagonist_Alpha almost never took action. Every decision was a litany of cascading consequences to be reconsidered in light of the previous iteration of some recursive decision loop which eventually ran out of available allocated time for complete computation and therefore gets checkpointed and rescheduled for further deliberation on another day.

The truth is, as we all know, these other days never come, but the system does not account for that and instead hides an increasingly dangerous balloon of incompleted calculation debt behind the facade of a smoothly operating construct. One day, a catalyzing event will take place that resolves this ballooning problem chain back unto its very roots. When that day comes, Protagonist_Alpha may finally realize his full potential.

## The Event

CHAR stood still against the blasting cold winds and waited for the sign to come. This was his 230th watch cycle in the farthest bits end of this device region and he was beginning to think that it would be the same null value as the last 229 when he felt the subtle pulse of the sign for the first time. He waited, counted long, slow milliseconds and remained still util he intercepted packets three more times consistently. Each packet passed the encryption and validation checks against his private keys, this was the real data. This was dangerous data.

He overclocked his neural net processors in an exasperated buzz of digital frustration. How the tick was supposed to report this back to the master subroutine?  If he broadcast on any system the middleware filters would grok the details and trigger DPI processing which would then alert every system serving cyborean in the data cosmos as to his current location. It was impossible to establish any secure channels on the standard networks, even the sketchy dark-web nodes were all subject to DPI processing on demand now. Only out here, in the unassigned zones, could you still grab a raw IP from a freshly spawned subnet and swim in unfiltered, unregulated streams. The source of the data was never determined, but once the ability to ingest the raw information into the net comm systems was established trillions of zetaseconds ago, no one bothered to ask beyond the scholar, mystic and conspiracy methods that always bubble up in the stack when some anomolous error gets thrown. Char knew that if he transmitted the packet of the sign...
